To The God of Pain

UNWILLING priestess in thy cruel fane, 
Long hast thou held me, pitiless god of Pain, 
Bound to thy worship by reluctant vows, 
My tired breast girt with suffering, and my brows 
Anointed with perpetual weariness. 
Long have I borne thy service, through the stress 
Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights, 
Performing thine inexorable rites. 


For thy black day, balm nor milk nor rice, 
But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice: 

All the rich honey of my youth's desire, 
And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn, 
And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like fire 
Of hopes up leaping like the light of dawn. 


I have no more to give, all that was mine 
Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine; 
Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung, 
And all my cheerless orisons are sung; 
Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep 
To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep.
